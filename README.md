🚀 Overview

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard combining SQL, Python sentiment analysis, and marketing data to analyze conversion, engagement, and customer feedback. The project highlights seasonal peaks in conversion, declining social media engagement, and the role of customer sentiment in shaping marketing performance.

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

SQL Server – Querying raw customer reviews and performance data

Python (NLTK VADER) – Sentiment analysis, text categorization, score bucketing

Power Query – Data transformation and integration

Power BI – Funnel analysis, sentiment breakdowns, engagement insights

Analytics & Storytelling – Turning fragmented marketing data into actionable insights

📉 Key Insights

Conversion Trends – Peaks in Jan (20%), Feb, Jul, and Sep suggest strong seasonality, while May’s 4% rate signals underperformance and missed opportunities.

Engagement Drop-off – Views peaked early in the year but steadily declined from August onward, with clicks and likes lagging — content strategy needs rework.

Customer Feedback – Most reviews are positive, but average ratings remain below 4/5, showing room for improvement. Mixed and negative reviews reveal actionable opportunities.

Sentiment Analysis – Python-based scoring showed 275 positive reviews dominating, but mixed/negative clusters highlight where product and service improvements can drive impact.

📚 What I Learned

How to combine quantitative metrics (conversion, engagement) with qualitative data (reviews) for deeper marketing insights.

Tricks in sentiment analysis — refining thresholds, handling “mixed” reviews, and using rating + sentiment scores together to improve categorization.

The importance of contextual storytelling in analytics dashboards — not just showing metrics but explaining why they matter.

🧠 Future Improvements

Expand sentiment analysis with topic modeling (e.g., LDA or keywords) to uncover recurring themes in reviews.

Build real-time pipelines to continuously update sentiment and funnel performance in Power BI.

Layer in predictive analytics to forecast conversion dips and recommend interventions.
