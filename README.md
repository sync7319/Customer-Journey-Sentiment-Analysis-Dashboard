# Customer-Journey-Sentiment-Analysis-Dashboard
This project was built to improve at sentiment analysis and to demonstrate something similar to a project I worked on professionally, though I canâ€™t disclose the data. Using SQL, Python (NLTK VADER), Power Query, and Power BI, I built a dashboard to show funnel performance, product trends, and customer sentiment.
